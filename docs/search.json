This suggests that both human-related limitations and infrastructure vulnerability (like power lines) play a role in fire escalation.\nThe detection agent type showed weak evidence that fires detected by UNP agents may be less likely to become large, compared to FPD Staff, but the effect was not statistically strong (p = 0.09). Further exploration is needed here, especially considering the early intervention ability of different detection teams.\nThese findings provide insights into key environmental and operational factors influencing wildfire severity. Importantly, they point to the need for targeted mitigation strategies in areas with poor detection access or high infrastructure risks.\nIn the broader context of equity, this analysis reinforces that resource constraints and delayed detection—often more common in remote or underfunded regions—can amplify wildfire impacts. Data-informed strategies can help ensure more equitable protection against climate-driven disasters.\n\nInterpretation Boost using marginaleffects\nWind Speed\nAs wind speed increases, the model estimates a higher probability of a fire becoming large (&gt;10 hectares). However, the variability in the predicted probabilities also increases at higher wind speeds, as indicated by the wider confidence intervals. This suggests that while there is a general upward trend, the model’s certainty about the exact magnitude of the effect decreases in this range—likely due to fewer observations or greater variability in fire outcomes at high wind speeds.\n\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\n\nWarning: package 'marginaleffects' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n## continuous variable\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"WIND_SPEED\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\nAs temperature increases, the model predicts a relatively stable probability of a fire becoming large. The trend line flattens and the confidence intervals narrow, indicating that the model is more confident and consistent in its estimates across higher temperature ranges. This suggests that the relationship between temperature and fire size is more stable and predictable at higher temperatures, possibly due to a larger number of observations or less variability in outcomes.\n\n## continuous variable \"TEMPERATURE\"\n\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"TEMPERATURE\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Cause\nThe predicted probability of a large fire is near zero for most TRUE_CAUSE categories, indicating that these causes (e.g., natural ignition, campfires, equipment use) are generally not associated with large-scale fires. However, the category “Insufficient Resources” stands out with a significantly higher predicted probability and a wide confidence interval. This suggests that fires classified under this cause are much more likely to become large, though the wide interval reflects substantial uncertainty — likely due to a small number of observations in that category.\n\n## categorical variable \"TRUE_CAUSE\"\nplot_predictions(model, by = \"TRUE_CAUSE\") +\n  ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    title = \"Predicted Probability of Large Fire by True Cause\",\n    x = \"True Cause\",\n    y = \"Predicted Probability\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Agent Type\nAlthough fires detected by AIR agents appear more likely to become large, the model is relatively uncertain about this pattern. The wide confidence interval indicates that this result should be interpreted cautiously, and may reflect data sparsity or high variability in fire outcomes for AIR-detected cases.\n\n## categorical variable \"DETECTION_AGENT_TYPE\"\nplot_predictions(\n  model,\n  by = \"DETECTION_AGENT_TYPE\"\n)"
